# Skill Reference

AKILI ships Claude/OpenCode skills alongside the slash commands. Skills are loaded by the agent when a task needs domain-specific guidance.

The installable source files live in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. These pages are the human-facing reference.

The skill set is **curated, not accumulated**: every skill declares its original author/license and a binding level that says when and how it loads. The rules — binding taxonomy, frontmatter schema, and the acceptance checklist for new skills — live in [governance.md](governance.md). Curation and AKILI adaptation by Juan Carlos Cadavid — jcadavid.com, always preserving original authorship.

| Binding | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `core` | Hard-wired to a precise command step — the command loads it by name |
| `conditional` | Loaded when the work touches its domain (UI, animation) |
| `stack` | Selected per project via the `## Skill Map` scaffolded by `/akili-constitution`; never hardcoded in command text |

## Usage Rules

- Use the task-specific skills listed in `tasks.md` during `/akili-execute`; when a task lists none, derive them from the project's `## Skill Map`.
- Use UI/UX skills when specs affect screens, flows, interactions, or accessibility (`ui-ux-pro-max` preferred; `frontend-design` + `stitch-design` as fallback).
- Use `gsap-animation` for animation work, reading only the `references/` file matching the task.
- Use `systematic-debugging` before proposing fixes for failures or unexpected behavior.
- Use stack skills only when the repository or task actually uses that framework — the project Skill Map is the source of truth.
- If a skill is unavailable in the host tool, fall back to the documented alternative and note the gap in the relevant report.
