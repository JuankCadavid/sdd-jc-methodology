## Install

Copy the repository `.claude/commands` and `.claude/skills` folders into your Claude configuration location.

## Workflow

Recommended command order:

1. `/sdd-constitution`
2. `/sdd-specify <spec-path>`
3. `/sdd-execute <spec-path>`
4. `/sdd-test <spec-path>`
5. `/sdd-validate <spec-path>`

## Spec Paths

Commands accept a relative path under `docs/specs/`, not only a flat module name.

Examples:

- `loan`
- `enhancements/renewals`
- `admin/user-management`

## Dependencies

Included skills cover the default methodology path.

Optional external skill:

- `ui-ux-pro-max`

Fallback rule:

- when `ui-ux-pro-max` is unavailable, use `frontend-design` + `stitch-design` for system-design work and `frontend-design` for UI validation/testing support.

## Methodology Contract

- `/sdd-constitution` establishes the project baseline docs and `docs/specs/general-setup/` templates.
- `/sdd-specify` must follow those templates when generating module specs.
- `/sdd-execute` implements tasks from an approved spec path.
- `/sdd-test` validates requirement-to-test traceability.
- `/sdd-validate` audits implementation conformance against the spec and constitutional baseline.

## Host Assumptions

- The host Claude environment can ask follow-up questions to the user during command execution.
- The host environment can load local skills referenced by the commands.
- Repository-specific build, lint, and test commands should be preferred over hardcoded stack assumptions.

## Notes

- Commands were sourced from the current global Claude command setup.
- Skills were copied with their bundled references and helper assets.
- This repository stores the current methodology baseline so it can be reused or versioned independently.
