# Claude Guidance

This repository packages the SDD JC methodology for reuse in Claude Code and OpenCode.

## Start Here

- Read `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide development and release rules.
- Read `README.md` for installation and methodology usage.
- Read `docs/release-checklist.md` before preparing or publishing a package release.

## Methodology Files

- Commands live in `.claude/commands/`.
- Skills live in `.claude/skills/`.
- The installer lives in `bin/sdd-jc.js`.
- Helper scripts live in `scripts/`.

## Skill Usage

When working on tasks in this repository or when using the installed SDD JC methodology, load and apply the relevant available skills before implementation.

Use the packaged skills in `.claude/skills/` as the source of truth. Examples:

- Use `systematic-debugging` for bugs, test failures, and unexpected behavior.
- Use `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `tailwind-design-system`, or `shadcn-ui` for UI work.
- Use `gsap-*` skills for animation work.
- Use `react-doctor` and `vercel-react-best-practices` for React/Next.js changes.
- Use `angular-developer` for Angular projects, components, services, routing, forms, signals, SSR, accessibility, styling, animations, testing, and CLI tooling.
- Use domain skills such as `nestjs-expert`, `aws-serverless`, `api-design-principles`, or `product-manager-toolkit` when the task matches.

If a task document lists required or recommended skills, follow that list first.

## CodeGraph

This repository has CodeGraph initialized under `.codegraph/` for faster semantic code exploration.

- Use CodeGraph for existing-project analysis, symbol lookup, call flow, and impact checks when `.codegraph/` exists.
- Do not commit generated CodeGraph database files; `.codegraph/.gitignore` excludes local database artifacts.
- Keep `.codegraph/config.json` focused on repository source and methodology scripts, not large snapshots or generated outputs.
- If CodeGraph is unavailable in another project, continue with normal `Glob`, `Grep`, and file reads.

## Release Discipline

Every user-facing methodology or installer change should be reflected in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.

Repository changes and npm package updates are controlled separately. Do not publish from uncommitted changes. Do not claim the npm package is updated until `npm publish` succeeds and a post-publish smoke test confirms the published version.

Use:

```bash
npm run release:patch
npm run verify:cli
npm run pack:dry-run
npm run release:status
git diff --check
npm whoami --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Choose `release:minor` for new commands or install targets and `release:major` for breaking changes.

If publish fails, keep the release commit, document the blocker, and do not create a replacement version unless the failed version was actually published.

## Safety

- Never commit npm tokens, service account keys, `.npmrc`, or local MCP secrets.
- Never commit generated `.tgz` package files.
- Installer changes must preserve skip-by-default behavior unless the user passes `--force`.
