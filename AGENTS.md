# Agent Guidance

This repository packages the SDD JC methodology for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity.

## Repository Purpose

- `.claude/commands/` contains installable SDD command prompts.
- `.claude/skills/` contains installable methodology skills.
- `.claude/templates/` contains the default Leader, Implementer, and Reviewer personas used by the JCSPECS multi-agent harness. `/sdd-constitution` copies these into each project's `.agents/` directory.
- `bin/sdd-jc.js` installs commands, skills, and helper resources (including the agent templates) into Claude, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity config directories.
- `scripts/release.js` prepares controlled npm package releases.
- `docs/release-checklist.md` documents the release process.

## Development Rules

- Keep command prompts readable and tool-agnostic where possible.
- Do not add project-specific assumptions to reusable commands.
- Keep installer behavior safe: skip existing files by default and require `--force` to overwrite.
- Do not commit generated `.tgz` files or `node_modules/`.
- Do not commit service account keys, npm tokens, `.npmrc`, or local MCP config containing secrets.
- **Spec-to-Code Traceability:** Every commit made during `/sdd-execute` must be prefixed with `[SPEC:<spec-path>]` (e.g. `[SPEC:changes/add-remember-me] message`).
- **Pivot Protocol:** If execution invalidates approved specs, the agent must mark tasks blocked (`[~]`), record pivot details in `execution.md`, and obtain user sign-off.
- **Drift Auditing:** Run `/sdd-audit` to detect differences between active codebase reality and active system/detailed designs.
- **CodeGraph Re-indexing:** Remind or execute the re-indexing command during `/sdd-archive` to keep CodeGraph databases healthy.
- **Multi-Agent Harness:** `/sdd-execute` runs each task through a Leader → Implementer → Reviewer loop with a hard 3-attempt rework ceiling. Personas live in `.claude/templates/` (source) and project `.agents/` (deployed by `/sdd-constitution`). Do not collapse this loop back into a single-agent flow.
- **Model Routing is guidance-only.** Model selection per SDD phase is documented in `docs/model-routing.md` (capability tiers + a per-tool registry) and scaffolded into each project's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` by `/sdd-constitution` (Step 7C). Never add a `model:` key to command frontmatter and never inject models in the installer — a single value cannot serve both Claude Code (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) and OpenCode (`provider/model`), and it would break the model-agnostic install. The Reviewer must run on a different model than the Implementer (author ≠ auditor).

## Skill Usage

When working on tasks in this repository or when using the installed SDD JC methodology, load and apply the relevant available skills before implementation.

Use the packaged skills in `.claude/skills/` as the source of truth. Examples:

- Use `systematic-debugging` for bugs, test failures, and unexpected behavior.
- Use `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `tailwind-design-system`, or `shadcn-ui` for UI work.
- Use `gsap-*` skills for animation work.
- Use `react-doctor` and `vercel-react-best-practices` for React/Next.js changes.
- Use `angular-developer` for Angular projects, components, services, routing, forms, signals, SSR, accessibility, styling, animations, testing, and CLI tooling.
- Use domain skills such as `nestjs-expert`, `aws-serverless`, `api-design-principles`, or `product-manager-toolkit` when the task matches.

If a task document lists required or recommended skills, follow that list first.

## CodeGraph

This repository has CodeGraph initialized under `.codegraph/` for faster semantic code exploration.

- Use CodeGraph for existing-project analysis, symbol lookup, call flow, and impact checks when `.codegraph/` exists.
- Do not commit generated CodeGraph database files; `.codegraph/.gitignore` excludes local database artifacts.
- Keep `.codegraph/config.json` focused on repository source and methodology scripts, not large snapshots or generated outputs.
- If CodeGraph is unavailable in another project, continue with normal `Glob`, `Grep`, and file reads.

## Release Rules

Repository changes do not automatically update the npm package. A package update requires a version bump and publish.

Release governance:

- Do not publish directly from uncommitted changes.
- Every package-affecting repo change must have `CHANGELOG.md` notes before release preparation.
- Every npm update must use `scripts/release.js` through `npm run release:patch`, `npm run release:minor`, or `npm run release:major`.
- Publish only after verification passes and npm authentication is confirmed for a package maintainer.
- Do not claim npm is updated until `npm publish` succeeds and a post-publish smoke test confirms the published version.
- If publish fails, keep the release commit, document the blocker, and do not create a replacement version unless the failed version was actually published.
- Use `npm run release:status` before and after publishing to detect drift between npm, tags, GitHub Releases, and local release files.
- Keep the `Release Status` GitHub Actions workflow aligned with `npm run release:status`.

Use this flow:

1. Add change notes under `CHANGELOG.md` > `Unreleased`.
2. Commit feature, documentation, or fix changes.
3. Run one of:
   - `npm run release:patch`
   - `npm run release:minor`
   - `npm run release:major`
4. Run verification:
   - `npm run verify:cli`
   - `npm run pack:dry-run`
   - `npm run release:status`
   - `git diff --check`
5. Commit the release version update.
6. Confirm npm auth with `npm whoami --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
7. Publish explicitly with `npm publish --access public --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
8. Smoke test the published version with `pnpm dlx sdd-jc-methodology@<version> list`.

Use patch for small docs/fixes, minor for new commands or install targets, and major for breaking changes.

## Verification

Before committing package or installer changes, run:

```bash
npm run verify:cli
npm run pack:dry-run
git diff --check
```

When installer behavior changes, also test temporary targets:

```bash
node bin/sdd-jc.js install --tool all --dry-run
node bin/sdd-jc.js doctor --tool all
```
